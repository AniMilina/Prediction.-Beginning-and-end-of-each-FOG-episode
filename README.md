# Prediction.-Beginning-and-end-of-each-FOG-episode  

I completed this project as part of a competition on Kaggle - **Parkinson's Freezing of Gait Prediction**  
The aim of this competition is to identify freezing of gait (FOG), a debilitating symptom that many people with Parkinson's disease suffer from  
The competition task is to develop a machine learning model trained on data collected using a wearable 3D sensor on the lower back  

The competition data was collected by three research groups:

* The Center for Movement Disorders, Cognition and Mobility as mentioned above
* The Neurorehabilitation Research Group of the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium  
* The Mobility and Falls Translational Research Center at the Harvard Medical School/Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Aging Research in Boston  
* The Michael J. Fox Parkinson's Disease Research Foundation generously supported the data collection for this competition
